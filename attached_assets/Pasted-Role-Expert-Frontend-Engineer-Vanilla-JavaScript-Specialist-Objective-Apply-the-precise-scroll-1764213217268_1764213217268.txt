Role: Expert Frontend Engineer & Vanilla JavaScript Specialist.

Objective:
Apply the precise scroll-triggered reveal animations from typeless.com to the existing StoryCV landing page content. The goal is to mimic the fluid, sliding-up motion for all major content blocks as the user scrolls. This MUST be achieved using Vanilla JavaScript's Intersection Observer API and Tailwind CSS classes—DO NOT USE REACT OR FRAMER MOTION.

1. Technical Stack & Implementation (Strict)

Framework: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Must be used for layout and minimalist typography).

Animation Tool: Intersection Observer API combined with CSS transitions/keyframes.

File Strategy:

Modify HTML: Add the base utility classes (opacity-0, translate-y-8, transition-all, duration-700, ease-out) and a marker class (.scroll-reveal) to all elements that need the reveal effect.

Create New JS File: Create a single, new file named scroll-animation.js containing the entire IntersectionObserver logic.

Keep Existing Files: Do not modify the content of header.js, footer.js, or other existing JS files, only the main HTML structure and the new JS file.

2. Content Constraint (Strict)

You must preserve ALL existing headlines, subheadlines, feature descriptions, and body text.

Do not summarize, omit, or replace any existing textual content.

3. Design & Animation Specifications (The "Typeless" Scroll Effect)

Aesthetic Foundation: Apply a radical minimalist style using Tailwind CSS: high contrast (near-black text on near-white background), extensive whitespace, and clean sans-serif typography (e.g., Inter).

Default State (HTML): Every element that is scrolled into view must start:

opacity-0 (hidden)

translate-y-8 (slightly offset down)

transition-all duration-700 ease-out (set up the CSS transition)

Revealed State (JS/Observer): The Intersection Observer must add a single class (e.g., .visible) which removes the initial offset and sets opacity to 1.

.visible class definition (via Tailwind): opacity-100 translate-y-0.

Staggering: Implement a slight delay (e.g., using data-delay attributes on the HTML elements and reading these in the JavaScript) on sequential elements within a section (like list items or paragraphs) to mimic the smooth staggered entry.

4. Execution Plan

Ensure a sticky, low-profile Navbar exists at the top, potentially using backdrop-blur-md.

Update the main HTML structure with the necessary scroll-reveal classes and import the new scroll-animation.js file at the bottom of the body.

Create and implement the logic in scroll-animation.js.

Action:

Create the necessary scroll-animation.js file.

Refactor the main HTML content with the required Tailwind utility classes and scroll-reveal markers to implement the specified minimalist styling and the Intersection Observer logic.
