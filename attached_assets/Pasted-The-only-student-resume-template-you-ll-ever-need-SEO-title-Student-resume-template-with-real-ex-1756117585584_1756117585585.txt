The only student resume template you’ll ever need

SEO title: Student resume template with real examples you can copy
Meta description: Real student resume examples you can copy. Perfect for internships, part-time jobs, and your first full-time position.



Looking at student resume templates feels overwhelming at first. Too many formats. Too many rules. And if you don’t have much experience yet, it feels even harder to fill a page without sounding fake.
But a student resume doesn’t need to be complicated. It needs to be clear. Your contact details, your education, a few lines about what you’ve done so far like projects, part-time jobs and even volunteering. That’s enough to get started.

What is the best format for a student resume?
One page. One column. Clear headings. Bullet points. Reverse chronological order. Most recent things at the top. Margins between 0.5 and 1 inch. Font size 10.5–12, readable, no script fonts. Sans serif fonts for resume is recommended.
That’s it. 
Why this format works
It matches how recruiters scan. Left to right, top to bottom.


It is ATS friendly. No text in images or tables.


It makes tradeoffs obvious. You highlight proof in the first ⅓ of the page.


How to write a good resume as a student?
Focus on relevance. Show what you did, not what your responsibilities were. Use numbers when you can. Keep bullets short. Each bullet should answer: “Why should they care?”
Example:
Built a web app for a class project used by 30+ classmates to track deadlines.
Managed weekly events for a campus club, growing attendance from 40 to 120 students.

What are the sections of a resume
Contact info: name, email, LinkedIn, portfolio/GitHub.
Education: degree, university, graduation date, GPA if strong, relevant coursework.
Experience: internships, part-time jobs, projects.
Skills: tools, languages, software.
Optional: extracurriculars, volunteer work, awards.

Save as PDF unless the employer asks for Word.
Put your strongest section higher. If projects are your proof, move them above experience.
If you are struggling to stick to one page, remember: a resume is a decision tool, not a biography. Show proof of skills the job needs. Hide everything else.
Margins, fonts, and layout specs
Margins. 0.75 to 1 inch on all sides. If you need space, go 0.5 inch, never less.


Font size. 10.5 to 12 for body, 12 to 14 for headings.


Fonts. Any clean system font. No script fonts. Avoid icons.


Line spacing. 1.0 to 1.15. Add 2 to 4 pt space after each section.

Can you put extracurricular activities on a resume?
Yes. Treat them as leadership and impact.
Good examples
President, FinTech Society — grew membership from 60 to 140, secured 3 sponsor partners.


Captain, Volleyball Team — coordinated 12-player schedule and led training that improved set success by 18 percent.


Organizer, Women in Tech Hackathon — raised 8,000 in funding, managed 120 participants.


Avoid
Listing passive memberships without outcomes.

Your resume’s job is to earn a shortlisting. The hiring manager’s job is to reduce risk. Use numbers and outcomes to lower that risk.
Can you put babysitting on a resume?
Yes. Frame it as paid work with scope and outcomes.
Examples
Babysitter, self-employed — managed care for two children ages 4 and 7, improved homework completion from 50 percent to 100 percent over 3 months.


Tutor and caregiver — created a 6-week reading plan, raised reading level by one grade.






What makes a good student template
Use these criteria to judge any template.
Simple structure. One column. No tables.


Scannable headings. Education, Skills, Projects, Experience.


Keyword-friendly. Text, not images.


Tight spacing. Enough white space to breathe, but not wasteful.


Proof-first. Bullets show outcomes, not tasks.


We include three free templates below: Focus, Projects-first, and Research. Download links are at the end of this article.
