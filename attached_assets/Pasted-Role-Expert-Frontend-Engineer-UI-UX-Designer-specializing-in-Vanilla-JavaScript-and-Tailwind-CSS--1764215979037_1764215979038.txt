Role: Expert Frontend Engineer & UI/UX Designer specializing in Vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

Objective:
Globally refactor the structure of the StoryCV landing page (index.html) to convert every major content section EXCEPT THE HERO SECTION (e.g., Features, Testimonials, Pricing) into a visually distinct, self-contained "card" or "block" mimicking the floating appearance of elements on typeless.com.

1. Technical Stack & Implementation Constraints (Strict)

Framework: Vanilla HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript.

Animation: The existing scroll-reveal logic (using the Intersection Observer API as planned) must be maintained and applied to the new card containers.

Content: ALL existing textual content, links, and logical section hierarchy must be preserved intact.

2. Global Card Styling Rules (Mandatory)

For every major section EXCEPT THE HERO SECTION, the Agent must ensure the main content is wrapped in a new inner <div> that applies the following styles:

Floating Block Appearance: The inner card container must be styled to look distinct from its surroundings.

Border Radius: Use a large, modern border radius (e.g., rounded-3xl or rounded-4xl).

Border: Apply a subtle light gray border (e.g., border border-gray-300).

Shadow: Add a noticeable but soft shadow to "lift" the card off the page (e.g., shadow-lg or shadow-xl).

Section/Card Background Handling (Crucial):

Section Background Reset: The parent <section> element MUST have its background color reset to a neutral white (bg-white in Tailwind) or a very light base color. This creates contrast and allows the card to appear "floating."

Card Background Retention: The inner card <div> MUST retain the ORIGINAL background color that the parent <section> previously had (e.g., if the section was bg-gray-50, the card is now bg-gray-50. If the section was #fcedda, the card is now style="background-color: #fcedda;").

Padding & Margin: The card must have generous padding inside (p-8 or p-12) and appropriate margins/padding on the outer <section> to give the card space to "float."

3. Action:
Globally traverse and restructure the index.html to wrap the content of all major sections in the new card <div> using the styling rules defined above, while ensuring existing functional and scroll-reveal classes are correctly moved or reapplied.
