## Resumes aren’t about formatting. They’re about clarity.

Resumes matter, especially if:

- You’re switching stacks or careers  
- You’ve freelanced, built side projects, or shipped solo  
- You want more than “Led team. Improved performance. Lorem ipsum.”

StoryCV helps you show the *why* behind the *what*.

## How it works

Most resume builders start with a template.  
We start with questions.

1. Go to [story.cv](https://story.cv)  
2. Answer a few smart prompts  
3. Get a resume that doesn’t make you cringe

Our tech resume writer *asks better questions*, so you give *better answers*.
