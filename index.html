                            <p class="founders-note-text">Somewhere along the way, we stopped writing for people. We started optimizing for algorithms.<br>And in the process, we forgot the real point of a resume: to tell your story and open doors.</p>
                            
                            <p class="founders-note-text">Most people struggle to explain what they actually did.<br>Understandably so. Not because they lack impact, but because putting your journey into words is hard. You either undersell, overinflate or miss the magic completely.</p>
                            
                            <p class="founders-note-text">We couldn't find a single tool that helped you build a <strong>strong foundation</strong> and not just the polish bullet points in your resume.</p>
                            
                            <p class="founders-note-text">So we built StoryCV: A new kind of resume writer that listens, guides and helps you uncover the value you bring.</p>

                                    <p>We believe our AI resume writer is a powerful tool for many, designed to provide the benefits of a professional resume writer without the typical costs and hassles. Consider StoryCV if:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>You've been actively applying for jobs but aren't receiving interview calls.</li>
                                        <li>You're overwhelmed by ATS rules and want a resume that truly stands out to both machines and humans.</li>
                                        <li>You have a diverse or complex career journey (e.g., career changer, military transition, returning to the workforce, non-traditional path) and need help articulating your transferable skills and unique story effectively.</li>
                                        <li>You're a student or recent graduate looking for a professional edge that goes beyond basic career center advice to land your first impactful role.</li>
                                        <li>You're a mid-level, senior, or executive professional already employed, but preparing for your next strategic career move and need a powerful, updated resume.</li>
                                        <li>You need professional resume writing help but find traditional resume writers too expensive (often $200-$1000+) or too slow. StoryCV provides top-tier quality at an accessible price.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>However, Story.CV might not be your primary need if you're fully confident in your existing resume, consistently seeing results, and only seeking minor proofreading or light feedback. For everyone else looking to truly elevate their job search with a powerful, compelling resume, StoryCV is built for you.</p>
