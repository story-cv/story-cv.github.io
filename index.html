                                        <li>You have a diverse or complex career journey (e.g., career changer, military transition, returning to the workforce, non-traditional path) and need help articulating your transferable skills and unique story effectively.</li>

                                        <li>You're a mid-level, senior, or executive professional already employed, but preparing for your next strategic career move and need a powerful, updated resume.</li>
                                        <li>You need professional resume writing help but find traditional resume writers too expensive (often $200-$1000+) or too slow. StoryCV provides top-tier quality at an accessible price.</li>
