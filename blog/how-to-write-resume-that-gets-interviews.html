                    <p class="lead">The harsh truth? Most resumes get rejected in just 6 seconds. That's how long hiring managers spend on their initial review before deciding whether to continue reading or move to the next candidate.</p>

                    <p>But here's the good news: once you understand what hiring managers are actually looking for in those crucial first seconds, you can craft a resume that stops them in their tracks and compels them to pick up the phone.</p>

                    <h2>The 6-Second Resume Scan: What Hiring Managers Actually Look For</h2>

                    <p>Research shows that hiring managers follow a predictable pattern when scanning resumes. They look for:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Job title and company names</strong> - To quickly assess relevance</li>
                        <li><strong>Employment dates</strong> - To identify gaps or tenure</li>
                        <li><strong>Education credentials</strong> - For role requirements</li>
                        <li><strong>Skills and keywords</strong> - To match job requirements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If these elements aren't immediately clear and compelling, your resume gets discarded—regardless of how qualified you actually are.</p>

                    <h2>Strategy 1: Lead with Impact, Not Duties</h2>

                    <p>The biggest mistake job seekers make is listing what they did instead of what they achieved. Compare these examples:</p>

                    <div class="example-box bad-example">
                        <h4>❌ Duty-focused (weak):</h4>
                        <p>"Responsible for managing social media accounts and creating content."</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="example-box good-example">
                        <h4>✅ Impact-focused (strong):</h4>
                        <p>"Increased social media engagement by 150% and drove 2,000+ qualified leads through strategic content campaigns."</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Notice how the second example immediately tells the hiring manager the value this person delivered. Always start bullet points with action verbs and include quantifiable results whenever possible.</p>

                    <h2>Strategy 2: Master the ATS (Applicant Tracking System)</h2>

                    <p>Before your resume even reaches human eyes, it must pass through ATS software. Here's how to optimize for both robots and humans:</p>

                    <h3>ATS-Friendly Formatting:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)</li>
                        <li>Include section headers like "Work Experience" and "Education"</li>
                        <li>Avoid tables, graphics, and fancy formatting</li>
                        <li>Save as both .docx and .pdf versions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Keyword Optimization:</h3>
                    <p>Study the job posting and naturally incorporate key terms throughout your resume. If the posting mentions "project management," don't just say "managed projects"—use the exact phrase "project management."</p>

                    <h2>Strategy 3: The Power of the Professional Summary</h2>

                    <p>Your professional summary is prime real estate—it's often the first thing hiring managers read after your name. Make it count with this formula:</p>

                    <div class="formula-box">
                        <strong>Years of Experience + Key Skills + Biggest Achievement = Compelling Summary</strong>
                    </div>

                    <div class="example-box good-example">
                        <h4>Example:</h4>
                        <p>"Results-driven marketing manager with 7+ years of experience in digital campaigns and brand strategy. Led cross-functional teams to deliver 40% increase in qualified leads and $2M+ in new revenue. Expertise in marketing automation, analytics, and customer acquisition."</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Strategy 4: Quantify Everything</h2>

                    <p>Numbers grab attention and provide context. Instead of vague statements, include specific metrics:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Revenue generated or saved</li>
                        <li>Percentage improvements</li>
                        <li>Team sizes managed</li>
                        <li>Projects completed</li>
                        <li>Deadlines met or beaten</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you don't have exact numbers, make reasonable estimates based on your knowledge of the business impact.</p>

                    <h2>Strategy 5: Tailor for Every Application</h2>

                    <p>The days of "one resume fits all" are over. Top candidates customize their resumes for each application by:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Reordering bullet points to emphasize relevant experience</li>
                        <li>Adjusting keywords to match the job posting</li>
                        <li>Highlighting specific skills mentioned in the requirements</li>
                        <li>Modifying the professional summary for the role</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This doesn't mean rewriting everything—small, strategic adjustments can make a huge difference.</p>

                    <h2>The StoryCV Advantage</h2>

                        <li><strong>Add quantifiable results</strong> - Include at least 2-3 numbers per job</li>
                        <li><strong>Test ATS compatibility</strong> - Copy and paste your resume into a plain text editor</li>
                        <li><strong>Customize for your next application</strong> - Tailor keywords and emphasis</li>
