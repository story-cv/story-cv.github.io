                    <p class="lead">Your resume has 6 seconds. That's how long the average hiring manager spends on their first pass. In those crucial moments, they're not reading every word—they're scanning for signals that you're worth their time.</p>

                    <p>Most job seekers treat their resume like a grocery list of everything they've ever done. But the best resumes are strategic documents that tell a compelling story about why you're the perfect fit for the role.</p>

                    <h2>The Fatal Resume Mistakes That Kill Your Chances</h2>

                    <p>Before we dive into what works, let's address what doesn't. These common mistakes immediately disqualify otherwise qualified candidates:</p>

                    <div class="bad-example">
                        <h4>❌ Generic Objective Statements</h4>
                        <p>"Seeking a challenging position where I can utilize my skills and grow professionally."</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This tells hiring managers nothing about what you can do for them. It's all about what you want, not what you offer.</p>

                    <div class="bad-example">
                        <h4>❌ Responsibility Lists Instead of Achievements</h4>
                        <p>"Responsible for managing social media accounts and customer service."</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This is just a job description. It doesn't show the impact you made or the value you created.</p>

                    <h2>The Resume Formula That Gets Results</h2>

                    <p>Every successful resume follows this proven structure:</p>

                    <div class="formula-box">
                        <strong>Impact = Context + Action + Result + Value</strong>
                    </div>

                    <p>Let's break this down with real examples:</p>

                    <div class="good-example">
                        <h4>✅ Strong Achievement Statement</h4>
                        <p>"Increased social media engagement by 340% over 6 months by implementing data-driven content strategy, resulting in 25% more qualified leads for the sales team."</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Notice how this includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Context:</strong> Social media management role</li>
                        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Implemented data-driven content strategy</li>
                        <li><strong>Result:</strong> 340% increase in engagement</li>
                        <li><strong>Value:</strong> 25% more qualified leads for sales</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The 4-Section Resume Structure That Works</h2>

                    <h3>1. Professional Summary (Not an Objective)</h3>

                    <p>Your summary should be a 2-3 line pitch that immediately communicates your value proposition. Focus on what you can do for the employer, not what you want from them.</p>

                    <div class="good-example">
                        <h4>✅ Strong Professional Summary</h4>
                        <p>"Digital marketing specialist with 5+ years driving growth for SaaS companies. Expertise in conversion optimization and paid advertising has generated $2M+ in revenue. Proven track record of scaling campaigns from startup to enterprise level."</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>2. Core Skills & Technologies</h3>

                    <p>List your most relevant skills, but be strategic. Include both hard skills (specific technologies, certifications) and soft skills that directly relate to the role you want.</p>

                    <h3>3. Professional Experience</h3>

                    <p>This is where most resumes live or die. For each role, include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Company name, your title, and dates</li>
                        <li>2-4 bullet points highlighting your biggest achievements</li>
                        <li>Quantified results whenever possible</li>
                        <li>Action verbs that show leadership and initiative</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>4. Education & Certifications</h3>

                    <p>Keep this section concise unless you're a recent graduate. Include your degree, school, and graduation year. Add relevant certifications that strengthen your candidacy.</p>

                    <h2>The Numbers Game: Quantifying Your Impact</h2>

                    <p>Hiring managers love numbers because they provide concrete evidence of your abilities. Here's how to find and present your numbers:</p>

                    <h3>Revenue & Growth Numbers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sales figures you generated or influenced</li>
                        <li>Revenue growth percentages</li>
                        <li>Cost savings you implemented</li>
                        <li>Budget sizes you managed</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Efficiency & Productivity Numbers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Time saved through process improvements</li>
                        <li>Productivity increases</li>
                        <li>Quality improvements (error reduction, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Team or project sizes you managed</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What If You Don't Have Numbers?</h3>

                    <p>Not every achievement is easily quantifiable, but you can still create impact. Use phrases like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Consistently exceeded targets by..."</li>
                        <li>"Recognized as top performer for..."</li>
                        <li>"Selected to lead initiative that..."</li>
                        <li>"Improved process efficiency by..."</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Tailoring Your Resume for Each Application</h2>

                    <p>The days of one-size-fits-all resumes are over. The most successful job seekers customize their resume for each application. Here's how:</p>

                    <h3>1. Analyze the Job Description</h3>
                    <p>Identify the 3-5 most important requirements. These should be prominently featured in your resume if you have them.</p>

                    <h3>2. Mirror Their Language</h3>
                    <p>Use the same keywords and phrases from the job posting. If they say "project management," don't say "project coordination."</p>

                    <h3>3. Prioritize Relevant Experience</h3>
                    <p>Lead with your most relevant achievements, even if they're not your most recent ones.</p>

                    <h2>The Final Resume Checklist</h2>

                    <p>Before you submit your resume, run through this checklist:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Format:</strong> Clean, professional design with consistent formatting</li>
                        <li><strong>Length:</strong> 1-2 pages maximum (1 page for early career, 2 for experienced professionals)</li>
                        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Includes relevant keywords from the job description</li>
                        <li><strong>Contact Info:</strong> Professional email address and LinkedIn profile</li>
                        <li><strong>Proofreading:</strong> Zero typos or grammatical errors</li>
                        <li><strong>File Format:</strong> PDF to preserve formatting</li>
                        <li><strong>File Name:</strong> "FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Common Questions About Resume Writing</h2>

                    <h3>Should I include a photo?</h3>
                    <p>In most cases, no. Unless you're applying for a role where appearance matters (modeling, acting), photos can introduce unconscious bias and should be avoided.</p>

                    <h3>How far back should my work history go?</h3>
                    <p>Generally 10-15 years, unless older experience is directly relevant to the role you're seeking.</p>

                    <h3>Should I include references?</h3>
                    <p>No need to include "References available upon request." Employers will ask for references when they need them, and this just takes up valuable space.</p>

                    <h2>The Truth About ATS Systems</h2>

                    <p>Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are used by most large companies to filter resumes. While important, don't obsess over "beating the ATS." Focus on:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Using standard section headings</li>
                        <li>Including relevant keywords naturally</li>
                        <li>Avoiding complex formatting or graphics</li>
                        <li>Saving as PDF (most modern ATS can read PDFs)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Remember: even if you pass the ATS, a human will ultimately decide whether to interview you. Write for humans first, optimize for ATS second.</p>

                    <h2>Your Resume Is Just the Beginning</h2>

                    <p>A great resume opens doors, but it doesn't get you the job. Once you start getting interviews, you'll need to back up your resume claims with compelling stories and examples.</p>

                    <p>The investment you make in crafting a strategic, results-focused resume will pay dividends throughout your career. Every achievement you add, every story you refine, and every improvement you make builds a stronger foundation for your professional brand.</p>

                    <p>Start implementing these strategies today. Your future self—and your bank account—will thank you.</p>
