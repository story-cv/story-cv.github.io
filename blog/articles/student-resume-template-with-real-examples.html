                    <p class="lead">Looking at student resume templates feels overwhelming at first. Too many formats. Too many rules. And if you don't have much experience yet, it feels even harder to fill a page without sounding fake.</p>

                    <p>But a student resume doesn't need to be complicated. It needs to be clear. Your contact details, your education, a few lines about what you've done so far like projects, part-time jobs and even volunteering. That's enough to get started.</p>

                    <h2>What is the best format for a student resume?</h2>

                    <p>One page. One column. Clear headings. Bullet points. Reverse chronological order. Most recent things at the top. Margins between 0.5 and 1 inch. Font size 10.5–12, readable, no script fonts. Sans serif fonts for resume is recommended.</p>

                    <p>That's it.</p>

                    <h3>Why this format works</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>It matches how recruiters scan.</strong> Left to right, top to bottom.</li>
                        <li><strong>It is ATS friendly.</strong> No text in images or tables.</li>
                        <li><strong>It makes tradeoffs obvious.</strong> You highlight proof in the first ⅓ of the page.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>How to write a good resume as a student?</h2>

                    <p>Focus on relevance. Show what you did, not what your responsibilities were. Use numbers when you can. Keep bullets short. Each bullet should answer: "Why should they care?"</p>

                    <div class="good-example">
                        <h4>✅ Strong Student Achievement Examples</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Built a web app for a class project used by 30+ classmates to track deadlines.</li>
                            <li>Managed weekly events for a campus club, growing attendance from 40 to 120 students.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2>What are the sections of a resume</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Contact info:</strong> name, email, LinkedIn, portfolio/GitHub.</li>
                        <li><strong>Education:</strong> degree, university, graduation date, GPA if strong, relevant coursework.</li>
                        <li><strong>Experience:</strong> internships, part-time jobs, projects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Skills:</strong> tools, languages, software.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optional:</strong> extracurriculars, volunteer work, awards.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Default layout</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Contact and links</li>
                        <li>Headline or target role</li>
                        <li>Education</li>
                        <li>Skills</li>
                        <li>Projects and coursework</li>
                        <li>Experience (internships, part-time, freelance)</li>
                        <li>Leadership and activities</li>
                        <li>Awards and extras</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Save as PDF unless the employer asks for Word.</p>

                    <p>Put your strongest section higher. If projects are your proof, move them above experience.</p>

                    <p>If you are struggling to stick to one page, remember: a resume is a decision tool, not a biography. Show proof of skills the job needs. Hide everything else.</p>

                    <h2>Margins, fonts, and layout specs</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Margins.</strong> 0.75 to 1 inch on all sides. If you need space, go 0.5 inch, never less.</li>
                        <li><strong>Font size.</strong> 10.5 to 12 for body, 12 to 14 for headings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fonts.</strong> Any clean system font. No script fonts. Avoid icons.</li>
                        <li><strong>Line spacing.</strong> 1.0 to 1.15. Add 2 to 4 pt space after each section.</li>
                        <li><strong>File name.</strong> firstname_lastname_resume_role.pdf</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Can you put extracurricular activities on a resume?</h2>

                    <p>Yes. Treat them as leadership and impact.</p>

                    <div class="good-example">
                        <h4>✅ Good examples</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>President, FinTech Society</strong> — grew membership from 60 to 140, secured 3 sponsor partners.</li>
                            <li><strong>Captain, Volleyball Team</strong> — coordinated 12-player schedule and led training that improved set success by 18 percent.</li>
                            <li><strong>Organizer, Women in Tech Hackathon</strong> — raised $8,000 in funding, managed 120 participants.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="bad-example">
                        <h4>❌ Avoid</h4>
                        <p>Listing passive memberships without outcomes.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Your resume's job is to earn a shortlisting. The hiring manager's job is to reduce risk. Use numbers and outcomes to lower that risk.</p>

                    <h2>Can you put babysitting on a resume?</h2>

                    <p>Yes. Frame it as paid work with scope and outcomes.</p>

                    <div class="good-example">
                        <h4>✅ Examples</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Babysitter, self-employed</strong> — managed care for two children ages 4 and 7, improved homework completion from 50 percent to 100 percent over 3 months.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tutor and caregiver</strong> — created a 6-week reading plan, raised reading level by one grade.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2>What makes a good student template</h2>

                    <p>Use these criteria to judge any template.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Simple structure.</strong> One column. No tables.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scannable headings.</strong> Education, Skills, Projects, Experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Keyword-friendly.</strong> Text, not images.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tight spacing.</strong> Enough white space to breathe, but not wasteful.</li>
                        <li><strong>Proof-first.</strong> Bullets show outcomes, not tasks.</li>
                    </ul>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Marketing intern</h3>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Student resumes don't need to be perfect. They need to show you can learn, contribute, and take responsibility. That's enough to get in the door.</p>
